1. Why we need NULL Statements?

2. What does "(void)" means below?

3. 	You have an intern(trainee) in your company. You are an experienced programmer.
	Your task is making Code review and give some advices to your intern.
	What do you want to say when you see "goto" statements in his code?
	
4. What is function overloading?

5. What is the output of code below:

#include <stdio.h>

int a = 10;

int main()
{
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)	
		printf("%d", ++i);printf("%d", --i);

	return 0;
}

6. How many parameters have functions below?
- void func(func2(2));
- printf("StudentId: %d CGPA: %f", id, cgpa); 
- printf("Name: %s StudentId: %d CGPA: %f", name, id, cgpa);

7.Give 4 examples to control statements?

8. We learned that there is no function overloading in C.
   We learned also people developed Operating Systems with C and we can do everything with C.
   Then comes this question: 
   Can you give me an example how we can solve our function overload needs in C that functions can get 2,3,10,100 parameters.
   Without function overloading how could we did it in our lesson-12?
   
9. We learned that we can return a value from our newly defined function to main function.
   Is there any other possibly to get a calculated value from a function and use it in main function?
   
10.Which pupose could we use return value of main function?

11. In C we have a library function that can takes 2 optional parameters.
	Can you give us examples, how many different ways we could call this function?
	
	calculate_area(int height, int width = 5, int length =3);
	for example: 
	calculate_area(25);
